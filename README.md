**What was the goal of this project?**

1 - To understand how to target the user input using synthetic events to retrieve specific information from an API and display accordingly.

2 - How to use Axios in combination with async/await.

**What do I want to understand next?**

1 - How to fetch data via multiple endpoints within an API using 'useEffect' rather than having a separate async function where I have all states listed.

**What were the challenges of this project?**

1 - Understanding which synthetic events were needed for capturing everything the user typed and displaying with relevant API query.
